# Digital-Dashboard
Hello! This is my final project for ENGG 233 course where I learned my first language (Processing). The project is a digital dashboard displaying data from a given table in several different charts and dials. My extra addition to the project was a radio where you can click on different channels for different songs. 
Sometimes it can be tricky to run processing files since it saves different tabs from the original code seperately. To see the final product without downloading the code, look at the "Digital Dashboard Sample" file. It shows a screen recording of the running code.
